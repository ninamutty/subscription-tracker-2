# SubTracked
SubTracked allows users to better track services that they subscribe to with the goal of combating some of the behavioral biases that consumers face in the growing subscription economy.

SubTracked was an independent project built in one month as a Capstone, final project for the classroom portion of [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/) (Cohort 6).
